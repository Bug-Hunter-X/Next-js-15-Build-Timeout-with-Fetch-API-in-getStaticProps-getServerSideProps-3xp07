In Next.js 15, an uncommon bug can occur when using the `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` functions with a custom API route that uses the `fetch` API to retrieve data from an external service.  If the external service is slow to respond or temporarily unavailable, the Next.js build process might timeout, leading to a build failure. This timeout doesn't always result in an obvious error message, making it difficult to debug. The application may appear to build successfully, but the data fetched within `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` is stale or missing.
